# Determining Hold Time Through LSTM Models: A Dive into Interval and Span

In financial trading, the hold time, which refers to the duration a financial instrument is held, significantly influences the trading strategy's potential returns and risks. One way to optimize the hold time is through employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, which excel in capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data. This article explores how different interval and span settings can be utilized in LSTM models to derive insights into the optimal hold time for a given trading strategy.

### 1. **Interval and Span: Setting the Stage**

Interval and span settings are crucial as they define the granularity and the range of data that will be fed into the LSTM model. For instance, an interval of '5minute' with a span of 'day' provides a high-resolution view of a single trading day, which could be ideal for intraday trading strategies.

### 2. **Intraday Trading: A Short-term View**

For intraday trading, where the hold time is within a single trading day, a smaller interval such as '5minute' or '10minute' with a span of 'day' is appropriate. This setup allows the LSTM model to capture intraday price movements accurately.

### 3. **Swing Trading: A Medium-term View**

In swing trading, the hold time extends to several days or weeks. Here, an interval of 'hour' with a span of 'week' or 'month' could provide a balanced view of price movements over a more extended period.

### 4. **Long-term Investing: A Long-term View**

For long-term investing strategies, where the hold time stretches over months or years, an interval of 'day' or 'week' with a span of 'year' or '5year' is more suitable. This setup allows for a broader view of price trends.

### 5. **Backtesting and Refinement**

Backtesting the LSTM model with different interval and span settings across various trading strategies is crucial for understanding how these settings impact the hold time. This iterative process helps in refining the model to better align with the trading strategy.

The exploration of hold time through LSTM models, aided by varying interval and span settings, provides a structured approach to optimize trading strategies. This methodology not only helps in understanding the price dynamics of financial instruments but also in aligning the trading strategy with the market conditions for better trading outcomes.

Enjoy the exploration of trading strategies through the lens of LSTM models and the nuanced settings of interval and span.
