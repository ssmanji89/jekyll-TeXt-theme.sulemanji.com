title: "AI Analysts for API Driven NOC Operations"
---

# Summary

This project aims to design and implement an AI-driven orchestration layer, powered by AutoGen, integrated within a Network Operations Center (NOC). This orchestration layer will operate in line with Microsoft Azure certifications AZ-104, AZ-305, AZ-400, AZ-800, and AZ-801, and will serve roles such as Security Engineer, Security Operations Analyst, and Solution Architect.

## Objectives

1. **Automate NOC Operations**: Utilize AutoGen's capabilities to automate routine NOC tasks.
2. **Role-Based Execution**: Align AutoGen's functionalities with the roles of Security Engineer, Security Operations Analyst, and Solution Architect.
3. **Compliance and Security**: Ensure adherence to Azure's compliance norms and security best practices.
4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms.
