# Zabbix AI-Orchestration Layer Development

## Overview

- **Project Lead**: [Suleman S. Manji](mailto:ssmanji89@gmail.com)
- **Team Members**: 
- **Estimated Budget**: $150,000
- **Funding Status**: Unfunded
- **Timeline**: 1-year
- **Contact**: [ssmanji89@gmail.com](mailto:ssmanji89@gmail.com)

## Description

The project aims to develop a robust AI-Orchestration Layer for Zabbix, leveraging the principles of the AutoGen project to enhance the monitoring, alerting, and orchestration capabilities of Zabbix. This orchestration layer will facilitate real-time multi-agent conversations, diverse application construction, enhanced inference, and optimized monitoring workflows within the Zabbix ecosystem. It will solve the challenges of manual monitoring configurations, delayed incident responses, and limited automation currently faced by organizations, ultimately elevating their cybersecurity posture and operational efficiency.

## Objectives

- Develop a Multi-Agent Conversation Framework for Zabbix to enable real-time interactions between monitoring agents and other integrated systems.
- Construct diverse applications to extend Zabbix’s monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- Enhance inference and optimize monitoring workflows to reduce false alarms and streamline alerting procedures.
- Facilitate seamless integration of Zabbix with external systems and ensure scalability, flexibility, and security of the orchestration layer.

## Milestones

- Milestone 1 (90-days): Completion of Requirement Analysis and Design Phase.
- Milestone 2 (90-days): Development and Testing of Core Orchestration Modules.
- Milestone 3 (90-days): Integration with Zabbix and External Systems.
- Milestone 4 (90-days): Project Completion, Documentation, and Deployment.

## Funding Usage

The funding will be utilized in the following manner:
- Development Resources: $80,000
- Testing and Quality Assurance: $20,000
- Integration and Deployment: $30,000
- Documentation and Training: $10,000
- Contingency: $10,000
