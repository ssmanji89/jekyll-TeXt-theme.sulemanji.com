## Introduction

This analysis aims to explore the factors that influence patients' attendance at medical appointments. Understanding these factors is crucial for healthcare providers to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care.

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of 110,527 medical appointments and contains details such as patient's age, gender, health conditions, and whether they showed up for the appointment.

## Key Findings

### Age and Attendance

- Older individuals are more likely to attend their medical appointments compared to younger individuals.

### Health Conditions and Attendance

- Patients with health conditions like hypertension and diabetes are more likely to attend their appointments.

### Waiting Time

- The 'WaitingTime' feature, representing the number of days between the scheduled day and the appointment day, could be an important factor in predicting 'No-shows'.

## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Reminders**: Older individuals seem more responsible in keeping their appointments. Hence, SMS reminders could be more effectively targeted at younger age groups.

2. **Health Condition Prioritization**: Patients with health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes should be closely monitored to ensure they do not miss their appointments.

3. **Further Analysis**: The 'WaitingTime' feature can be integrated into future predictive models to improve their accuracy.

# Commercialization Plan: Predicting Patient Attendance Using AWS

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a scalable, secure, and compliant solution for healthcare providers to predict patient attendance for medical appointments using AWS resources. By leveraging AWS's robust capabilities, this platform aims to optimize healthcare resources, reduce operational costs, and enhance patient care.

## Objectives

1. To develop a highly accurate predictive model for patient attendance.
2. To create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for healthcare providers.
3. To ensure scalability, robust security, and compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.

## AWS Resources

### Data Storage and Management

- **Amazon S3**: For secure and compliant data storage.
- **AWS Glue**: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.

### Compute

- **Amazon EC2**: For running data analytics engines.
- **AWS Lambda**: For event-driven computing.

### Machine Learning

- **Amazon SageMaker**: For machine learning model development, training, and deployment.

### Analytics and Visualization

- **AWS QuickSight**: For analytics and visualization.

### Security and Compliance

- **AWS IAM**: For identity and access management.
- **AWS KMS**: For key management and data encryption.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Storage

2. **Data Ingestion**: Use AWS Glue for ETL processes.

### Phase 2: Data Processing and Analytics

1. **Data Cleaning**: EC2 instances armed with data cleaning algorithms.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Utilize domain expertise and AWS compute power for feature engineering.

### Phase 3: Machine Learning and Analytics

1. **Model Training**: Leverage Amazon SageMaker's capabilities for model training.
2. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Use SageMaker for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

### Phase 4: User Interface and Experience

1. **Dashboard Creation**: Utilize AWS QuickSight for dashboard creation.
2. **User Feedback Loop**: Implement feedback mechanisms via the dashboard.

### Phase 5: Maintenance and Monitoring

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Use Amazon CloudWatch.
2. **Security Audits and Compliance Checks**: Periodic checks using AWS Config and AWS Audit Manager.

## Financial Projections

- **Initial Setup**: Approx. $10,000 - $15,000
- **Ongoing Costs**: Approx. $1,500 - $2,500 per month

## Risk Assessment

1. **Data Security**: Multi-layered security using IAM and KMS.
2. **Compliance**: Continuous compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to healthcare regulations.

## Conclusion

This AWS-powered predictive analytics platform provides a comprehensive solution for healthcare providers to effectively predict patient attendance, optimize resources, and improve patient care.
