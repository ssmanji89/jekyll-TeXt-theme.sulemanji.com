## Description

This project endeavors to construct an AI-Orchestration Layer tailored for Wazuh, utilizing the AutoGen framework to enrich the Extended Detection and Response (XDR) capabilities of Wazuh. The orchestration layer will enable real-time multi-agent interactions, automate threat detection and response workflows, and extend Wazuh's functionalities. It aims to tackle the manual intervention required in monitoring configurations, incident responses, and to enhance the cybersecurity stance of organizations by leveraging AI-driven threat responses.

## Objectives

- Develop a Multi-Agent Conversation Framework for Wazuh to enable real-time interactions between monitoring agents, external systems, and orchestration of AI-driven threat responses.
- Construct diverse applications to extend Wazuh's XDR capabilities and integrate with external APIs such as ticketing systems, email notifications, and threat intelligence platforms.
- Enhance the inference and optimize monitoring workflows to reduce false alarms, streamline alerting procedures, and automate incident responses.
- Facilitate seamless integration of Wazuh with AutoGen and external systems, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and security of the orchestration layer.

## Milestones

- Milestone 1 (March 31, 2024): Completion of Requirement Analysis and Design Phase.
- Milestone 2 (June 30, 2024): Development and Testing of Core Orchestration Modules.
- Milestone 3 (September 30, 2024): Integration with Wazuh, AutoGen, and External Systems.
- Milestone 4 (December 31, 2024): Project Completion, Documentation, and Deployment.

## Funding Usage

The funding will be utilized in the following manner:
- Development Resources: $80,000
- Testing and Quality Assurance: $20,000
- Integration and Deployment: $30,000
- Documentation and Training: $10,000
